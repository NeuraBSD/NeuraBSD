# NeuraBSD - System Documentation {#mainpage}

Welcome to the technical core of **NeuraBSD**. 

NeuraBSD is a modern, aesthetic, and highly functional operating system built upon the security and stability of OpenBSD. Our goal is to create a seamless bridge between purist BSD engineering and a future-oriented user experience.

## The Architecture
The NeuraBSD ecosystem is structured into three primary pillars, ensuring a clean and modular system flow:

1.  **CoreSeed**: The graphical installer. The journey begins here.
2.  **DaemonPath**: Our specialized boot manager, controlling the secure and efficient system startup.
3.  **AxonSurface**: The modern Desktop Environment (DE), blending high efficiency with clear, minimalist design.

## Project Information
- **Organization:** NeuraBSD
- **Lead Developer:** Daniel Hilbert (@DH-NBSD) | [codeakrobat.de](https://codeakrobat.de)
- **Email:** lead@neurabsd.org
- **License:** BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License

## Development Standards
To maintain system integrity and clarity, all contributions must adhere to the following guidelines:
- **KNF Standard:** Source code follows the Kernel Normal Form (Tab width = 8).
- **Bilingual Documentation:** All files must be documented with comments in both **German** and **English** for precision and global collaboration.
- **Workflow:** The system sequence is strictly defined: Graphical installation via CoreSeed -> Booting via DaemonPath -> User session in AxonSurface.
