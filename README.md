# NeuraBSD

**Pure BSD excellence.**

NeuraBSD is a modern, integrated operating system ecosystem designed for clarity, performance, and a non-GNU toolchain. Engineered for the next generation of BSD users.

## The NeuraBSD Journey

In NeuraBSD, everything is designed to work as a seamless unity:

1.  **CoreSeed**: It all begins with a professional, graphical installation.
2.  **DaemonPath**: The system boots through our native, purist boot manager.
3.  **AxonSurface**: Finally, the user is welcomed by a modern, integrated Desktop Environment.

## Project Structure (Monorepo)

This repository follows the traditional BSD "Base System" approach, housing all core components in one place to ensure perfect compatibility:

* `/projects/CoreSeed` - Graphical Deployment Engine (C23 / Qt6)
* `/projects/DaemonPath` - Native Boot Manager
* `/projects/AxonSurface` - Desktop Environment
* `/src` - The NeuraBSD core system & kernel (based on OpenBSD)

## Core Principles

* **No GNU Ballast**: A commitment to a pure BSD ecosystem.
* **Modern Standards**: Leveraging C23 for the backend and Qt6 for the frontend.
* **Consistency**: Unified design language and system integration from boot to desktop.

*Remember: Everything starts with CoreSeed, then DaemonPath, then AxonSurface.*
